$CMP MAX1555
D The MAX1551/MAX1555 charge a single-cell lithium-ion
(Li+) battery from both USB and AC adapter sources.
They operate with no external FETs or diodes, and
accept operating input voltages up to 7V.
On-chip thermal limiting simplifies PC board layout and
allows optimum charging rate without the thermal limits
imposed by worst-case battery and input voltage. When
the MAX1551/MAX1555 thermal limits are reached, the
chargers do not shut down, but progressively reduce
charging current.
The MAX1551 includes a POK output to indicate when
input power is present. If either charging source is
active, POK goes low. The MAX1555 instead features a
CHG output to indicate charging status.
With USB connected, but without DC power, charge cur-
rent is set to 100mA (max). This allows charging from
both powered and unpowered USB hubs with no port
communication required. When DC power is connected,
charging current is set at 280mA (typ). No input-blocking
diodes are required to prevent battery drain.
The MAX1551/MAX1555 are available in 5-pin thin SOT23
packages and operate over a -40°C to +85°C range.
