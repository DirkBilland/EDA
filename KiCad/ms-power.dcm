$CMP LM334
D The LM134/LM234/LM334 are 3-terminal adjustable current sources featuring 10,000:1 range in operating current, excel- lent current regulation and a wide dynamic voltage range of 1V to 40V. Current is established with one external resistor and no other parts are required.

$CMP MAX4080
D The MAX4080/MAX4081 are high-side, current-sense amplifiers with an input voltage range that extends from 4.5V to 76V making them ideal for telecom, automotive, backplane, and other systems where high-voltage cur- rent monitoring is critical. The MAX4080 is designed for unidirectional current-sense applications and the MAX4081 allows bidirectional current sensing. The MAX4081 single output pin continuously monitors the transition from charge to discharge and avoids the need for a separate polarity output. The MAX4081 requires an external reference to set the zero-current output level (VSENSE = 0V). The charging current is rep- resented by an output voltage from VREF to VCC, while discharge current is given from VREF to GND.
