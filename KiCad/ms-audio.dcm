$CMP MAX13330
D The MAX13330/MAX13331 stereo headphone amplifiers
are designed for automotive applications requiring out-
put short-circuit and ESD protection to battery/ground
with diagnostics. These devices use Maxim’s unique
DirectDrive® architecture to produce a ground-refer-
enced output from a single supply, eliminating the need
for large DC-blocking capacitors, saving board space
and component height. The gain of the amplifier is set
internally (-1.5V/V) on the MAX13330 or adjusted exter-
nally with resistors on the MAX13331.
The MAX13330/MAX13331 deliver 120mW per channel
into a 16Ω load or 135mW into a 32Ω load and have a
low 0.01% THD+N. Low output impedance and the effi-
cient integrated charge pump allows the device to drive
loads as low as 8Ω, enabling the use of small loud-
speakers. An 80dB at 217Hz PSRR allows these
devices to operate from noisy digital supplies without
an additional linear regulator. These devices include
±15kV Human Body Model ESD protection and short-
circuit protection up to +45V at the headphone outputs.
Comprehensive click-and-pop circuitry suppresses
audible clicks and pops on startup and shutdown. A
low-power shutdown mode reduces the supply current
to 3μA (typ).

$CMP MAX5541
D The MAX5541 serial-input, voltage-output, 16-bit monoto- 
nic digital-to-analog converter (DAC) operates from a 
single +5V supply. The DAC output is unbuffered, result- 
ing in a low 0.3mA supply current and low 1LSB offset 
error. The DAC output range is 0V to VREF. The DAC 
latch accepts a 16-bit serial word. A power-on reset 
(POR) circuit clears the DAC output to 0V (unipolar 
mode) when power is initially applied.
